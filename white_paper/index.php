								<b><u><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></b></u><br>
				SPERO was originally created from a code of a currency already in development by the Brazilian Marciano Valverde. From the base of his code some adjustments and improvements were applied in order to transmit the
more complete and pure code.<br>
				Initially overseen by Francis Santana, a former member of Foundation MarteX (base currency), SPERO began on September 25, 2017, and this date can be confirmed in our code available at
<a href="https://github.com/DigitalCoin1/DigitalCoinBRL" target="_blank"> GITHUB </a>.
				Thus, the following information was generated on September 25:<br>
				<p>
				• Merkle: 0x6f5dd836da72471e5ea8f3c836249e447059f9f7c7c26a2f91fecd0c509dd677<br>
				• Timestamp: "A esperanca eh a ultima que morre."<br>
				• block.nTime: 1506335848<br>
				• block.nNonce: 44360;<br>
				• GenesisBlock: 0x000006f4925ed7b889f847f24621390d4943466f091c3254ca1bd8becc517f7b<br>
				</p>
				Starting the Genesis block, then blocks 01 and 02 were pre-mined with hashs: 00000fff3b93a589e494558ef101a61ca0d3e66f6e5639eb4711ee16db45d265 and 000007fdef936b937d6935b12ce732e275bab1805e103e639b4c9c6ebf3b0bec
respectively.<br>
				In these two blocks were mined the amount of 100,000.00000000 SPERO, which will be distributed throughout the project in order to maintain the same asset and always seeking improvements.<br>
				After this episode we had some problems to keep it online and the draft was discontinued by Francis Santana.<br>
				The SPERO team was then developed to continue the services initially provided by Francis.<br>
				In this quest to keep the code alive, a fork was held and more improvements were made from this fork.<br>
				The project had its fork held on September 26 where all data on pre-mining was maintained. The wallet with pre-mining balance was then reallocated and the code was sent back to the
<a href="https://github.com/DigitalCoin1/DigitalCoinBRL" target="_blank"> GITHUB </a>.<br>
				<b>SPERO was reborn here!</b>
				<p><h3>Reduction of social differences</h3>
				The initial proposal of SPERO is to create a currency that can be used by any user without complications and delays in the transactions. We want to bring a coin that is usual in our day to day life, either by a freelance salesperson
or by a large supermarket chain.<br>
				The basis of this project is to help people with low income or almost no income to achieve the minimum of dignity possible in life in society.<br>
				We want students who suffer from their high costs in studies, can make their snacks, buy books and do much more using our system at zero cost.<br></p>
				<p><h3>Ecology</h3>
				Besides the fact of trying to reduce the social difference, we would also like to bring a new vision ecologically to the world of crypto-coins.<br>
				Much has been seen with respect to currencies with PoS technology, but little has been done to make this system effective. With SPERO, we hope that this problem is also remedied or at least mitigated.<br></p>

<p id="PROBLEM"><div class="row form-group">
			<center style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;padding-top:5%">
								<b><u><h2>THE PROBLEM</h2></b></u><br>
				Think of a world where you can buy your favorite products, your favorite food and still to conquer it, you do not have to spend the price that is imposed on that item or service with your current national currency ...<br>
				Would not that be interesting?<br>
				Be able to pay for your wife's dinner, buy your child's toy or snack at the door of your school or work without having to tinker with your monthly budget.<br>
				Since the year 2009 this is possible through a decentralized monetary system created by one (or a team) known worldwide by Satoshi Nakamoto. It was created from a source code developed by this being (or team)
an entirely different banking system from the conventional one, where all the transactions take place without any intermediary or bank delays due to their working hours.<br>
				BITCOIN was created to meet all these needs and best of all: it was available for free!<br>
				Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet could perform the known mining and obtain in exchange for the result of the labor test some coins provided by this system.<br>
				Mining consisted of solving mathematical problems and this resolution was done through processors that were used to their extreme to guarantee speed and accuracy in the answers.<br>
				Here begins the first problem:<br>
				Over the years the currency was getting more and more known and more users began to make use of this medium. However, with the growth of users, procurement has become increasingly difficult because there are always
improvements in processor fabrications and thus older processors and becoming obsolete.<br>
				Then began the race to obtain coins!<br>
				The newer your processor and the better your processing power, the faster you get the Satoshis (BITCOIN Fractional Unit). With this race, the market price began to leverage and each
more and more users arrived.<br>
				Here, then, a new modality begins: the participation of companies for professional mining (ASIC).<br>
				Companies began to develop machines with incredibly strong hardware and charged absurd prices for their acquisition.<br>
				Many users started buying these equipments and those who did not have the conditions, began to enter schemes known as "cloud mining" or mining in the cloud, where the big companies bought numerous ASICs and
with this they served the rent of the power of processing to its users.<br>
				 The counterpart of this scheme was first of all the very high risk of hiring a service that could never give you any return and in return if you bought the equipment the consumption of energy was very high,
often making mining damage.<br>
				To get an idea an ASIC S9 costs on average $ 2200 with a consumption of 1300W! With this we have the consumption superior to that of an air conditioner (1200W) !!!<br>
				In this way we sometimes have professional companies with more than 50 machines connected at the same time ... The consumption of electric energy is absurd and totally unsustainable ecologically speaking.<br>
				<br><p><img src="img/bitcoinfarm.jpg"><br><font style="font-size:12px">Professional Mining Center</font><br></p>
				Thus, only the rich get richer, waste their high costs that are often not paid and the end user is totally at the mercy of these entities.<br>
				Another major problem reported and experienced with the increase in the number of users of the BITCOIN network was the delay of confirmation of a transaction, or even the addition of this transaction in Blockchain.<br>
				A BITCOIN block can receive up to approximately 1.02Megabytes (day) or almost 292,359 transactions per day. To send your transaction to this block and be added to Blockchain you pay a fee known as "fee". The rate
BITCOIN standard today is 0.00001BTC, and if you pay a higher rate, your transaction has a higher priority than the others and will be added to the block faster.<br>
				Suggesting this, if the block were at number 292,358 and your transaction was the one that closed the block and someone sent a rate higher than yours, your transaction would only enter the next block.<br>
				With this, the expense with high rates is often unsustainable economically speaking and when it is sent with standard rate, the waiting time is gigantic (it can take more than 1 day).<br>

<p id="SOLUTION"><div class="row form-group">
			<center style="text-align:center; font-size:18px;padding-top:5%">
								<b><u><h2>THE SOLUTION</h2></b></u><br>
				SPERO has come to fill in the gaps left by the original BITCOIN proposal.<br>
				We introduce PoS mining or proof of stake, where the network selects a portfolio and creates a block within it. When creating the block you receive a reward of participation of the transaction.<br>
				In this way, the higher your balance, the greater the chances of being selected.<br>
				The premium paid by SPERO is equivalent to <b> 25% </b> per year of the total value of your portfolio.<br>
				This way all you need is a computer running SPERO software and keeping it connected by following some simple rules:<br>
				<br><p style="text-align:left;">→ Keep the wallet online at least 2 hours a day and at most 12 hours;<br>
				→ Keep the wallet unlocked for participation;<br>
				→ The higher your balance, the faster you can be covered by the net draw;<br>
				→ The balance equals its "weight" of the network;<br>
				→ Balance greater than 1 SPERO<br></p>
				The advantages of this type of mining are numerous, and the most outstanding is the possibility of participating in this mining without having to spend money on equipment with high prices. You can use
that old Pentium or a RaspBerry for example!<br>
				In this way comes the second advantage: The low power consumption.<br>
				Initially we propose the distribution of phases of our project, being divided in number of blocks:<br>
				• From block 0 to 33331 = PoW and PoS mining phase;<br>
				• From block 33332 to 263250 = PoS mining phase;<br>
				• From block 263251 above = PoW and PoS mining phase<br>
				<br>
				In addition, we have the advantage of scalable or adjustable block according to the need of the network. Remember the example of BITCOIN? For it is our blocks have maximum time of 60 seconds and after this is recorded in the book.
If the network needs to use 292,360 transactions or more than 20MB all within 60 seconds, all transactions will be sent!<br>
				With this we gain agility in extremely fast transactions and compensation:<br>
				<br>
				<p>• 03 confirmations for user-to-user transactions;<br>
				• 05 confirmations for mined transactions<br></p>
				Thus the transactions have a maximum time of 5min to be registered in the block in the PoS mining phase and less than 3min in the hybrid mining phase.<br>
